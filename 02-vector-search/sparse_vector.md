🔍 What is a _sparse vector_?
-----------------------------

A **sparse vector** is a vector representation of text where **most of the values are zeros**, and only a few positions have non-zero values.

### ✅ How does it work?

Imagine you have a "dictionary" of words where each word is assigned a **unique index**:

"apple"    1 → "banana"    2 → "cloud"    3 → "DataFrame"    ...    999 → "spark"   `

When you want to represent a piece of text as a vector, each word in the text sets a 1 at its corresponding position in the vector.

Example:

Text: "banana spark"Vector (simplified): \[0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 1\]

— Only the positions for "banana" and "spark" are set to 1. Everything else is 0.

Since most of the entries are zeros, this is called a **sparse** vector.

💬 What are the advantages of sparse vectors?
---------------------------------------------

1.  **Great for exact matches**: If you're looking for exact word matches (like names, IDs, codes), sparse vectors work very well.
    
2.  **Easily extendable**: You can add new terms to the dictionary without retraining anything—just assign a new index.
    
3.  **Efficient in some engines**: Many traditional search engines (like Elasticsearch or Apache Lucene) are optimized for sparse vectors.
    

🧠 How are they different from _dense vectors_ (embeddings)?
------------------------------------------------------------

**Dense vectors** (aka embeddings), like those generated by BERT or OpenAI models:

*   Contain **continuous values** (e.g., 0.12, -0.97, 0.33, etc.), not just 0s and 1s.
    
*   Do **not** have one position per word — the entire vector captures the **semantic meaning** of the whole text.
    
*   Great for **semantic similarity**, but not as reliable for exact keyword matching.
    
*   Have **fixed size** (e.g., 384 or 768 dimensions), and can't be extended easily — you'd need to fine-tune the model.
